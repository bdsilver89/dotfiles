# Inspired by ThePrimagen's tmux-sessionizer with a few edits
# 
# Mainly the change that running tmux-windowizer <NAME>
# is targetted for opening a new tmux window with the name <NAME>
# AND ALSO cd-ing into the folder with that name (if applicable)
# 
# This is mostly useful for things like git-worktrees:
#   1. Use tmux-sessionizer to open the repo root folder
#   2. Use tmux-windowizer to open a branch in a new window
